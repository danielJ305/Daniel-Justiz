        <p>Hello, I'm a Web Developer, I have a diverse set of skills,
            ranging from Graphic Design to Web Development. Every day I
            get better and I'm one step closer to becoming a software engineer.
            I always keep busy and when I'm not working, I like to read, exercise, 
            and do outdoor activities.</p>
